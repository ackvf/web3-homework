# React & Ethereum Development Assignment

## **Overview**
Your task is to create a React-based frontend application that interacts with an Ethereum-compatible network using EIP-4337 Account Abstraction. The app should provide users with the ability to:

1. **Create a Smart Contract Wallet** (or simulate its creation).
2. **Send transactions** (ETH or ERC-20 tokens) using the Smart Contract Wallet.
3. **View transaction history** for the wallet.

This assignment is designed to test your React skills, Ethereum development expertise, and ability to integrate third-party APIs.

## **Features**

### **1. Smart Contract Wallet Integration**
- Use an EIP-4337 bundler service to manage smart contract wallets.
- Provide functionality to create or simulate the creation of a Smart Contract Wallet.

### **2. Send Transactions**
- Allow the user to:
  - Input the recipientâ€™s address.
  - Specify the amount of ETH or ERC-20 tokens to send.
  - Optionally customize the gas fee.

### **3. Transaction History**
- Display the transaction history of the wallet by fetching data using an Ethereum provider or a service like the Etherscan API.

### **4. Live Updates (Bonus)**
- Implement WebSocket updates or polling to refresh the transaction list when new transactions occur.

## **Technical Requirements**

### **Frontend Framework**
- Use React with functional components and hooks.
- TypeScript is mandatory for type safety.

### **Ethereum Interaction**
- Use Ethers.js, Viem or a similar library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
- Integrate with a wallet provider like MetaMask or WalletConnect.

### **EIP-4337**
- Utilize an open EIP-4337 bundler service for wallet creation and transactions.
- You can use a pre-existing implementation of a Smart Contract Wallet compatible with EIP-4337.

### **Styling**
- Use a modern CSS framework like TailwindCSS, Material-UI, or similar to style the application.

### **Error Handling**
- Handle errors gracefully with appropriate messages (e.g., invalid addresses, insufficient gas, or network issues).
